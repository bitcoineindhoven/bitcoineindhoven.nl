## Upcoming events

- ### 2024-10-11 Meetup #5 Place du Nord Eindhoven

Normally every first Friday of the quarter some bitcoiners meet in the wild. This time it’ll be on the second friday. This is due to the combination of the antwerp and amsterdam conference during this week. The mining workshop on the 12th of october and this meetup on the 11th fit much better in the conference schedule. Eindhoven is also easily reachable from Amsterdam.

There is an interview and QnA with Jelmer ten Wolde. The title of the interview “Why heat recovery and load balancing are critical to survive the bitcoin mining future". Half an hour interview and half hour questions. After this informative hour you can enjoy food and drinks and pay with bitcoin. Parking garage almost underneath the venue. It’s a 5 minutes walk from the central station of Eindhoven.
